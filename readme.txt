Easily add media library images to your blogroll items (links).

== Description ==

By default WordPress lets you take quite a few steps for adding images from your media library to your blogroll items (links). This plugin simplifies that process.

After enabling you'll find the upload icon at the Image field (Advanced block). Click that to select the image you would like to use for that particular link.

Don't have the image in your media library? No problem! Since it's using the built-in media uploader screen you can easily upload images from the spot!

Found the image you were looking for? Click the "Add to post" button and the image is automatically added to the image input-field.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the folder `` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start using it
